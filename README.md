# Little Things I Learn In This Little Project
1. **The axios request config is `data`, not `body`**: In the beginning, I copy the request code as Node.js fetch from browser DevTool(F12 -> Network -> Right click on the request), and the code use body as config, cause error in my code, see commit `9d5cc1596` for more.
